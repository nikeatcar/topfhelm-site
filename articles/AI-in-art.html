</div>

    <section class="article-body">
    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">Hey everyone. This is the first and last time I'm going to speak on the use of AI in art.</strong></h2>

    <p>
    Every once in a while, someone pops into my comments trying to <strong>lecture me</strong> on what is or isn’t "real" art, what tools I should or shouldn’t use, and how I'm supposedly doing it "wrong."
    These people believe they carry the authority to define the boundaries of art for everyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
    Usually, I try to engage because I see them as <em>lost souls</em>, genuinely confused, trying to navigate their own paths.
    But most of the time, it leads nowhere.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let me be clear: <strong>I'm against</strong> total AI automation of creativity.
    <strong>But I'm all for</strong> using AI as a tool — <em>not the only one, but a necessary one</em> — in a modern artist’s toolkit.
    </p>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">I've lived through every digital revolution</strong></h2>

    <p>
    I was born in the 1980s and I’ve witnessed it all — the rise of personal computers, the internet, smartphones, and now, AI.
    </p>

    <p>
    And every time something new appeared, people panicked:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><em>"Computers will replace humans!"</em> — They didn’t.</li>
    <li><em>"The internet will make us antisocial!"</em> — It didn’t.</li>
    <li><em>"Google will kill schools and libraries!"</em> — Still open.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    This fear of progress is ancient. People feared the printing press. They feared synthesizers. They feared electric guitars.
    <strong>Luddites</strong> — yes, that’s the name — smashed weaving machines in the 1800s because they feared losing their jobs to technology.
    </p>

    <p>
    What they really feared was <strong>irrelevance</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">AI is just another instrument</strong></h2>

    <p>
    People scream about AI in music. Why?<br>
    Synthesizers have existed for decades. Arpeggiators can play chords from a single key press.
    DAWs allow you to loop, quantize, and fix timing — and nobody’s calling that <em>fake music</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Dungeon Synth</strong>, for example, is built in DAWs. Many artists use default presets. Some barely change them.
    Nobody complains — because it’s about the <em>atmosphere</em>, the <em>feeling</em>, the <em>soul</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>DAW didn’t kill music.</strong> It gave birth to thousands of new voices.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>AI won’t kill creativity</strong> — unless you never had any to begin with.
    </p>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">But AI learns from real artists!</strong></h2>

    <p>
    Yes. <strong>So do humans.</strong><br>
    Every single artist alive has studied the work of others. Every great musician grew up inspired by greater ones.
    That’s called <em>learning</em>. That’s how art works.
    </p>

    <p>
    Is it <strong>theft</strong> when 500 death metal bands sound the same?<br>
    Is it theft when a folk artist imitates medieval melodies?
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Double standards don’t make a good argument.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">Visual artists: let's talk about honesty</strong></h2>

    <p>
    A few years ago, <strong>nobody cared</strong> about "art theft" when people ripped images off Google for their blog posts.<br>
    But now people rage when I use an AI-generated visual and touch it up in Photoshop?
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Who are these people paying $500 per image</strong> for every social media post?<br>
    What fantasy world do you live in?
    </p>

    <p>
    I used AI to make a cover for <em>Sanguis et Mulsum</em>. Then I <strong>refined it manually</strong> — logo, filters, lighting.<br>
    And guess what? <strong>People loved it.</strong><br>
    Not because of the AI. Because of the <em>sound</em>, the <em>feeling</em>, the <em>concept</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>AI didn’t write that EP. I did.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">AI art lacks soul — and that’s the point</strong></h2>

    <p>
    <strong>AI can’t feel.</strong> It can’t suffer, love, grieve, or hope.<br>
    It doesn’t understand silence between notes. It doesn’t know why we tremble at a minor chord.
    </p>

    <p>
    That’s why you’ll always be able to tell the difference between something <strong>made with AI</strong> and something <strong>made by a human using AI</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>AI is a sketchpad, not a painter. It’s a demo, not a song.</em><br>
    And real artists? <strong>We’ve always used what we had to make what we wanted.</strong>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    “The medium is the message.” – Marshall McLuhan<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">The tools shape the art. That’s normal. That’s inevitable.</span>
    </blockquote>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">What about ethics?</strong></h2>

    <p>
    Let’s be clear: <strong>I don’t lie.</strong> I don’t pretend AI-made art is mine.
    I say what was generated, and what I’ve edited. <em>That’s called being transparent.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
    What’s <strong>not okay</strong> is claiming 100% authorship on something you barely touched.<br>
    But that’s not a problem with AI — <strong>that’s a problem with people being dishonest.</strong><br>
    And that’s been around forever.
    </p>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">So here’s what I stand for:</strong></h2>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Use every tool that inspires you.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Don’t let snobs tell you what art is or isn’t.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Respect originality, but don’t fear influence.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>If AI helps you go further — use it. If it doesn’t — don’t.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Real artists adapt. Mediocre ones complain.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">Final words to the haters</strong></h2>

    <p>
    I don’t make music for fame. I don’t post for clout. I do this to leave something behind, however small.
    I’ve been doing this since before you were born, and I’ll keep doing it long after you forget about me.
    </p>

    <p>
    So go ahead, cancel me, spam my comments, write angry posts. Every hate comment helps the algorithm.
    <strong>Thank you for your service.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Meanwhile, I’ll be making music. <strong>With soul. With intent. With pain and solemn.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>Peace and love to my fans. Always.</em>
    </p>
