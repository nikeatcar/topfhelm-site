            <h2>What is Dungeon Folk?</h2>
            <p>Dungeon Folk is a musical genre that blends Dungeon Synth with folk traditions. Unlike classic Dungeon Synth, which relies on synthesizers, Dungeon Folk emphasizes acoustic folk instruments, creating a more authentic medieval atmosphere.</p>
            <p>This genre stands at the crossroads of neofolk, dark ambient, and medieval music, using instruments such as lute, hurdy-gurdy, violin, jaw harp, bagpipes, and flutes‚Äîeither played live or recreated through high-quality digital emulations.</p>
            <p>While the term Dungeon Folk appeared on Dungeon Synth forums several years ago, it was TopfHelm who actively pushed the genre into the online spotlight. Unlike other artists who mix folk elements with synths, TopfHelm completely abandoned electronic sounds, using realistic medieval instrument emulations to create the illusion of a live recording from a medieval castle, captured on an old tape recorder.</p>

            <h2>How is Dungeon Folk Created?</h2>
            <p>Dungeon Folk can be produced using live acoustic instruments or high-quality digital samples that mimic traditional folk sounds. The essential steps for crafting a Dungeon Folk track include:</p>
            <h3>Choosing Instruments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Instead of synthesizers, artists use string and wind instruments (lute, hurdy-gurdy, violin, jaw harp, bagpipes, flutes).</li>
                <li>Rhythmic elements include medieval drums or hand percussion (such as war drums or tambourines).</li>
                <li>Some musicians blend acoustic and synthetic elements, but natural, organic sound is key to Dungeon Folk.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Composition & Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspired by medieval ballads, minstrels, and traditional folk melodies.</li>
                <li>Often employs minor keys and modal scales (e.g., Dorian mode) to enhance the historical feel.</li>
                <li>Tracks can be melodic and danceable or dark and atmospheric, depending on the theme.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recording & Mixing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses warm analog-style processing to achieve an old-world, vintage feel.</li>
                <li>Heavy use of natural reverb, simulating the acoustics of medieval halls or stone castles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dungeon Folk vs. Dungeon Synth: What‚Äôs the Difference?</h2>

            <p>Some bands, such as Ridge Dweller, combine guitars and flutes with synth layers, but TopfHelm was the first to prove that Dungeon Folk could exist without electronic sounds, preserving an authentic medieval atmosphere.</p>
